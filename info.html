          These figures are just estimates based on data that most likely
          does not capture the full picture. There are many unknowns due to under
          reporting and imperfect data that require a number of assumptions
          to be made in creating this model. The intent is to simply visualize our estimates
          and quantify risk based on the available data. This model does not claim
          to fully depict the actual population, but instead serves as an estimate.</p>
